        <p>Hi, I’m MD Zulqarnain Khan – a passionate learner, aspiring developer, and creative web developer based in Rajabazar, Kolkata.

            I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer Applications (BCA), and along the way, I’ve developed a strong interest in web development and design. I love turning ideas into functional, user-friendly websites that not only look great but also solve real problems.
            
            While technology excites me, my long-term goal is to become a dedicated and compassionate doctor. I believe that science and empathy go hand-in-hand, whether it's through writing clean code or caring for people. Both fields inspire me to keep learning and growing.
            
            I’m also exploring freelancing, using my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React to build projects for clients and gain hands-on experience. If you’re looking for someone who’s reliable, motivated, and always eager to improve — you’re in the right place!
            
            Thanks for visiting my website — feel free to check out my work or get in touch if you'd like to collaborate. </p>
